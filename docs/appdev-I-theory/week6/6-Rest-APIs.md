# Distributed Software Architecture

Distributed software architecture is a design where application components are spread across multiple machines connected via a network.

* Components run on **different systems**
* Communication happens via **network protocols (HTTP, TCP, etc.)**
* Enables **scalability & fault tolerance**


### Web Architecture

The structure used to build and deliver web applications using technologies like **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, HTTP**.


* Clients and servers may be **geographically far apart**
* Network conditions vary (latency, speed)
* Communication is **stateless and unreliable by default**

---

### Client–Server Responsibilities
:::tabs
== Client

* User interface
* Sends requests
* Displays response

== Server

* Stores data
* Processes logic
* Returns results

    Client1 --> Network
    Client2 --> Network
    Network --> Server
    Server --> Network
    Network --> Client1

```

# Assumptions in Distributed Systems

* ❌ Server is **not always on**
* ❌ Server does **not know client state**
* ❌ Authentication is **not automatic**
* ❌ Network latency is **unpredictable**


## What is an API?

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that allows software applications to communicate with each other.

### Why Use an API?

* Scalability
* Efficiency
* Automation
* Security


# REST Architecture 

* REST = **REpresentational State Transfer**
* A **set of design constraints**, not strict rules
* Designed for **real-world web limitations**


## REST Constraints


### 1 Client–Server
Separation of concerns

* Client → UI & interaction
* Server → data & logic
* Independent development
* Scalability


### 2: Stateless

Each request is independent
* Server does NOT remember past requests
* Client must send **all required data every time**
* Server does not know:
  * which page user was on
  * if user is logged in (unless token is sent)


```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server

    Client->>Server: Request (with all info)
    Server->>Client: Response

    Client->>Server: New Request (no memory)
    Server->>Client: Response
```


### 3: Layered System

System is divided into layers

#### Components

* Load Balancer
* Authentication Server
* Backend Servers

##### Benefits

* Security
* Scalability
* Flexibility

```mermaid
graph LR
    Client --> Network
    Network --> LB[Load Balancer]
    LB --> Auth[Auth Server]
    LB --> Backend[Backend Pool]
```

---

### 4: Cacheability

Responses can be stored (cached)

#### Benefits

* Faster responses
* Reduced server load

* Example: Browser caches images, CSS


```mermaid
graph LR
    Client --> Proxy[Cache / Proxy]
    Proxy -->|Cached Response| Client
    Proxy -->|Miss| Server
    Server --> Proxy
```

* `Cache-Control`
* `Expires`

---

### 5: Uniform Interface


Standard way of communication

### Rules

* Resources identified by **URLs**
* Use standard HTTP methods:

| Method | Purpose |
| ------ | ------- |
| GET    | Read    |
| POST   | Create  |
| PUT    | Update  |
| DELETE | Remove  |

#### Benefits

* Simplicity
* Consistency
* Easy to understand APIs

---

#### 6. Code on Demand

Server can send executable code

### Examples

* JavaScript
* Applets

## Summary Table

| Constraint        | Purpose                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| Client-Server     | Separation of concerns      |
| Stateless         | No memory on server         |
| Layered           | Modular system              |
| Cacheable         | Improve performance         |
| Uniform Interface | Standard communication      |
| Code on Demand    | Extend client functionality |

# REST (REpresentational State Transfer)

* Client - Server may be far apart & State?
* Different networks, latencies, quality
* Authentication? Not core part of protocol
* guidelines & constraints

### What is REST?

* REST is an **architectural style** for designing web services.
* Uses **HTTP methods** to operate on **resources**.
* Resources are identified using **URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers)**.
* Communication happens in a **client–server model**.


#### What does it actually mean?

* Every request from client → server must include **all required information (state)**.
* Server does **not remember previous requests**.
* This is called **stateless communication**.

::: info
* Everything is a **resource** (user, product, order, etc.)
* Each resource has:

  * A **URI**
  * A **representation** (JSON, XML, etc.)

```
GET /users/101
```

→ Fetch user with ID 101

:::

### REST Communication Flow (Sequence)

1. **Client accesses resource**

   * Uses URI (e.g., `/users/101`)
   * No prior state assumed

2. **Client specifies operation**

   * Using HTTP methods:

     * GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

3. **Server processes request**

   * Applies business logic
   * Interacts with database if needed

4. **Server sends response**

   * Returns:

     * Data (JSON/XML)
     * Status codes (200, 404, etc.)
     * Links to other resources (HATEOAS – optional advanced concept)

| Aspect             | CRUD                         | REST                         |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Definition**     | Basic database operations    | Architectural style for APIs |
| **Scope**          | Database level               | Web/API level                |
| **Operations**     | Create, Read, Update, Delete | Uses HTTP methods            |
| **Protocol**       | Not tied to any protocol     | Uses HTTP                    |
| **Focus**          | Data manipulation            | Resource-based communication |
| **Implementation** | SQL / ORM / DB logic         | APIs using URIs + HTTP       |
| **State**          | Internal DB state            | Stateless communication      |

* REST ≠ CRUD
* But:

  * REST **maps well to CRUD operations**

##  Idempotent Operations
* An operation is **idempotent** if:

  * Repeating it multiple times → same result as once

### Idempotent

* GET
* PUT
* DELETE
* HEAD
* OPTIONS

### Non-Idempotent

* POST
* PATCH



## Typical REST API Functionality

* CRUD operations
* Filtering & listing
* Create VM
* Restart server
* Control IoT devices



### **Flask Application with Idempotency Handling**
```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config["SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"] = "sqlite:///users.db"
app.config["SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS"] = False
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

# User model
class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)

# Initialize database
with app.app_context():
    db.create_all()

# ✅ IDEMPOTENT: PUT (Update or Create)
@app.route("/users/<int:user_id>", methods=["PUT"])
def update_user(user_id):
    data = request.get_json()
    user = User.query.get(user_id)
    
    if user:  # If user exists, update it
        user.name = data["name"]
    else:  # If user doesn't exist, create it (still idempotent)
        user = User(id=user_id, name=data["name"])
        db.session.add(user)

    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify({"id": user.id, "name": user.name}), 200

# ✅ IDEMPOTENT: DELETE (Always results in resource absence)
@app.route("/users/<int:user_id>", methods=["DELETE"])
def delete_user(user_id):
    user = User.query.get(user_id)
    
    if user:  # Delete if exists
        db.session.delete(user)
        db.session.commit()
        return jsonify({"message": "User deleted"}), 200
    else:  # If already deleted, response remains same
        return jsonify({"message": "User not found"}), 200

# ❌ NON-IDEMPOTENT: POST (Creates new entry every time)
@app.route("/users", methods=["POST"])
def create_user():
    data = request.get_json()
    new_user = User(name=data["name"])
    db.session.add(new_user)
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify({"id": new_user.id, "name": new_user.name}), 201

# Run the app
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```
