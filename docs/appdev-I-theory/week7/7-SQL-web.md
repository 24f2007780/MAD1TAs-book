# Tabular (Relational) Databases

- Data is stored in **structured** tables (rows × columns)
- Each row = record, each column = attribute
- Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL
- Ensures ACID properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.
- Supports complex queries (`JOIN, GROUP BY`)

## Indexing

- As tables grow large, quick searching becomes important:
  - **INDEX** is a data structure which is sorted or hashed representation of one or more columns with specific data types (e.g. `string/int/date`)
- **Fast lookup**: reduces search complexity from $O(N)$ (full scan) to $O(\log N)$ (B-tree) or $O(1)$ (hash index in ideal cases).
- Improves read performance at the cost of additional storage and slower write operations `INSERT/UPDATE`
- B-tree index supports prefix search `LIKE 'pattern%'` but NOT `LIKE '%pattern%'`
- Hash index supports only exact match (`=`), not pattern search  
- in-memory tables
  - ✅ equality comparisons ❌ range
  - ❌ `ORDER BY`
  - ❌ partial key prefix

:::details B-Tree Index

- Structure: Balanced tree (multi-level, disk-friendly)
- Search → $O(\log N)$
- Insert/Delete → $O(\log N)$
- Supports:
  - Equality: `=`
  - Range: `>, <, BETWEEN`
  - Prefix search: `LIKE 'abc%'`
- Does NOT support `LIKE '%abc'` efficiently:

Examples:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age BETWEEN 20 AND 30;
SELECT * FROM users 
-- Index-friendly
WHERE name LIKE 'Yas%'

-- Not index-friendly
WHERE name LIKE '%Yas%'
```

- Maintains sorted order
- Optimized for magnetic disk by minimizing the number of disk I/O operations.
:::

:::details Hash Index (supports exact matching `=` only)

- Uses a hash function to map keys to index positions.
- does not support `< >` range queries, sorting `ORDER BY`, `LIKE` pattern or `LIKE 'mad%'` prefix queries
- `SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'Yashvi';` like for key-value lookups or in-memory database
:::


| Feature         | B-Tree Index                                     | Hash Index               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Lookup          | avg $O(log N)$, best $O(1)$                      | avg $O(1)$, worst $O(N)$ |
| features        | range query `< >`, sorting, prefix `abc%` search | No                       |
| Exact Match `=` | Yes                                              | Yes                      |

```sql
-- Databases use the leftmost prefix rule for multi-column indexes
INDEX (A, B, C)

-- Efficient
WHERE A=1 AND B=2

-- Partial use
WHERE A=1

-- Not used
WHERE B=2
```

# NoSQL

NoSQL databases sacrifice strict consistency in some cases to achieve higher scalability and availability.

## Scale-up vs Scale-out
:::warning Scale Up vs Scale Out

As applications grow, systems must handle more users, data, and requests. This can be achieved by either **making a single machine more powerful (Scale Up)** or **adding more machines to share the load (Scale Out)**.


```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Increasing Load] --> B{Scaling Strategy}

    B --> C[Scale Up<br/>Single Machine]
    B --> D[Scale Out<br/>Multiple Machines]

    C --> C1[More RAM]

    D --> D1[Add Servers]
    D --> D2[Load Balancer]
    D --> D3[Distributed Data]
```
:::


## Scale Up (Vertical Scaling)

Scale up means increasing the capacity of a **single machine** by upgrading its hardware such as RAM, CPU, storage, and network.

| Aspect      | Description                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| Approach    | Upgrade one machine            |
| Advantage   | Simple to implement and manage |
| Performance | Improves immediately           |
| Limitation  | Hardware limits exist          |
| Risk        | Single point of failure        |
| Downtime    | Usually required for upgrades  |

- ideal for **small to medium systems** and **monolithic applications**.


## Scale Out (Horizontal Scaling)

Scale out means adding **multiple machines** and distributing workload across them using load balancing and data partitioning.

| Aspect      | Description                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Approach    | Add more machines                                 |
| Advantage   | Highly scalable and fault tolerant                |
| Performance | Improves with more nodes                          |
| Limitation  | System complexity increases                       |
| Risk        | Requires handling consistency and synchronization |
| Downtime    | Minimal with proper design                        |

- ideal for **large-scale, high-traffic systems** and **distributed applications**.



#### When to Use What?

| Scenario                            | Recommended Strategy |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| System is simple and under capacity | Scale Up             |
| Hardware upgrade is sufficient      | Scale Up             |
| System reaches hardware limits      | Scale Out            |
| High availability is required       | Scale Out            |
| Massive user traffic                | Scale Out            |

- In practice, systems often **start with scale up** because it is simpler, and then move to **scale out** when growth demands distributed architecture.

![](https://assets.serverwatch.com/uploads/2023/06/fig_a-decision_tree_scale_up_or_scale_out.png)


## CAP Theorem
- **Scaling Out ⇒ Distributed System ⇒ CAP Theorem applies** so it is **impossible to guarantee all three properties simultaneously**:
- **Consistency (C)**: all nodes return the same, latest data after a write operation.
- **Availability (A)**: every request receives a response (success or failure), even during failures.
- **Partition Tolerance (P)**: the system continues to operate despite network failures that split nodes.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    P[Network Partition Happens] --> Choice{Choose One}

    Choice --> C[Consistency]
    Choice --> A[Availability]

    C --> CP[CP System<br/>Strong Consistency<br/>May Reject Requests]
    A --> AP[AP System<br/>Always Responds<br/>May Return Stale Data]
```

- So systems choose:

| System Type | Guarantees                         | Behavior                                                   | Example Use Case              |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **CP**      | Consistency + Partition tolerance  | May reject requests during failure to maintain correctness | Banking systems (ACID)        |
| **AP**      | Availability + Partition tolerance | Always responds but may return stale data                  | Social media, feeds (BASE)    |
| **CA**      | Consistency + Availability         | Only possible **without partitions** (single-node systems) | Traditional single DB systems |

:::details Real scenario Example

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    U[Users] --> LB[Load Balancer]

    LB --> S1[App Server 1]
    LB --"..."--> S2[App Server 2]
    LB --> S3[App Server N]

    S1 --> DB1[(Shard 1)]
    S2 --> DB2[(Shard 2)]
    S3 --> DB3[(Shard N)]

    DB1 --> R1[(Replica)]
    DB2 --> R2[(Replica)]
    DB3 --> R3[(Replica)]
```

1. **Load Balancing**: distributes incoming requests across servers
- Prevents overload of a single server
- Improves availability and response time
- Commonly implemented using a load balancer
2. **Sharding (Horizontal Partitioning)**: Splits database by key
  - Users `1–1000 → DB1`
  - Users `1001–2000 → DB2`
  - Improves scalability 
  - reduces load per database
  - cross-shard queries more complex
3. **Caching (e.g., Redis)** improves read performance by storing frequently accessed data in memory.
- Stale data risk (if cache clear timeout is too long)
:::

:::tabs
==Replication
- Maintain multiple copies of data
- Improves **availability and read performance** as can provide from another copy 
- May introduce consistency issues (replica might be old state of "at the time of replication" than latest state)
- If no new updates occur, all replicas will eventually converge to the same state **eventual consistency**
==Redundancy
Redundancy means maintaining extra copies or components to improve system reliability and fault tolerance. Can include:
- Backup servers
- Duplicate hardware
- Extra storage copies
- Goal: **fault tolerance** (system keeps working if something fails)
:::

## Consistency Models

- A consistency model defines how and when updates made to data become visible to different parts of a distributed system.
  - It determines what value a read operation returns after a write.
  - It defines the ordering and visibility of updates across replicas.


:::tip **ACID**: Atomic, Consistent (might sacrifice → eventual), Isolated, Durable
- **Atomicity** → A transaction either fully completes or has no effect (all-or-nothing)
- **Consistency** → The database always remains in a valid state (constraints preserved)
- **Isolation** → Concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other
- **Durability** → Once committed, data is permanently stored (even after failures)

- Ensures strong consistency
- Used in relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- Suitable for critical systems (banking, payments)
:::

:::warning  **BASE**: Basically Available, Soft State, Eventually Consistent (high available replication)
- **Basically Available** → System remains available even during failures
- **Soft State** → Data may temporarily be inconsistent across nodes
- **Eventually Consistent** → If no new updates occur, all replicas will eventually converge to the same value

- Prioritizes availability and scalability
- Used in NoSQL systems (MongoDB, Cassandra)
- Suitable for social media, analytics, caching layers
