# Memory Hierarchy
![](https://cn.edurev.in/ApplicationImages/Temp/1421638_a9fe7b34-1e74-45f4-a8ae-cbbeea02d22a_lg.png?w=360&dpr=2.6)

Modern computer systems must balance **speed, cost, and storage capacity**.
No single memory type is optimal for all three simultaneously, so systems use a layered memory hierarchy based on speed and cost:

`Registers → Cache (SRAM) → Main Memory (DRAM) → Secondary Storage (SSD → HDD) → Cold Storage`

As we move from top to bottom:
- Latency increases (slower access)
- Throughput decreases (generally)
- Capacity increases
- Cost per bit decreases

SRAM → **Static** RAM <br>DRAM → **Dynamic** RAM

### Key Performance Metrics
1. **Latency**: time taken to access the first byte of data from a memory location (less is better)
`Register < SRAM < DRAM < SSD < HDD`
2. **Throughput** (Bandwidth) is the amount of data transferred per unit time $\frac{\text{no. of bytes read}}{\text{second}}$ (more is better)
`DRAM > SSD > HDD (regs, SRAM limited capacity)`
- `DRAM` provides the highest sustained bandwidth for bulk transfers than `SSD` and `HDD`
- `Registers` and `SRAM` are extremely fast but limited in size, so not used for large data transfers.

3. **Density** how much data can be stored per unit cost or physical space $\frac{\text{no. of bits stored}}{\text{cost x unit area}}$ ↑
` Registers < SRAM < DRAM < SSD < HDD`
- Registers are the most expensive per bit, while HDD provides the cheapest large-scale storage

## Storage Elements

<div class="card">
<h4> On-chip Registers (<span style="color:rgb(98, 151, 208)">10–100 Bytes</span>)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Located inside the CPU</li>
<li>Used for immediate computation and instruction execution</li>
<li>Acts as the CPU’s working notepad for executing instructions</li>
<li><b>Fastest memory available</b></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="card">

<h4>SRAM – Cache Memory (L1, L2, L3) (≈<span style="color:rgb(98, 151, 208)">few KB (L1) to several MB (L3 cache)</span>)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Stores frequently accessed data and instructions</li>
<li>Reduces access to slower DRAM</li>
<li>Exploits:</li>
<li><b>Temporal locality</b> → recently used data is likely to be used again</li>
<li><b>Spatial locality</b> → nearby data is likely to be accessed soon</li>
<li>Very fast but expensive → used in small amounts</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h4>DRAM – Main Memory (<span style="color:rgb(98, 151, 208)">0.1-10 GB</span> scale)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Holds active programs and working data</li>
<li>Volatile: data lost when power is off</li>
<li>Slower than cache but much larger</li>
<li>Acts as the primary working memory of the system</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h4>SSD – Solid State Drive (<span style="color:rgb(98, 151, 208)">100s of GB to several TB</span> Flash Storage)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Non-volatile storage (data persists without power)</li>
<li>No moving parts → lower latency than HDD</li>
<li>High throughput, used for OS and applications</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h4>HDD – Magnetic Disk Storage <span style="color:rgb(98, 151, 208)">100s of GB to 10s of TB </span></h4>
<ul>
<li>Very high capacity</li>
<li>Uses spinning disks and mechanical read/write heads</li>
<li>High latency due to mechanical movement (disk rotation)</li>
<li>Low cost per GB</li>
</ul>

:::warning Cache and locality of reference
Frequently accessed data is kept in faster memory levels to minimize access time.
- Cache reduces average memory access time by storing copies of frequently used data closer to the CPU.
:::
## Computer Organization

- CPU operates on data in `registers`
- Backed by `L1, L2, L3` cache (`SRAM`)
- Backed by several GB of `DRAM` working memory
- Backed by `SSD` for high read/write throughput and fast persistent storage.
- Backed by `HDD` for high capacity
- All layers are ultimately backed by **long-term backup systems**.
- This layered design ensures that frequently used data stays closer to the CPU,
minimizing expensive memory accesses.

:::warning Important Formula that estimates theoretical memory bandwidth based on hardware parameters such as clock speed and bus width.
$$\begin{aligned} &\text{Bandwidth=(Clock Speed)×(Data Transfers per Clock)×(Bus Width in Bytes)×(Channels)}\\ & \frac{800 \times 10^6 \times 8 \times 2 \times 2}{10^9}= \frac{25600}{1000}=25.6 \end{aligned}$$

### Cold storage
- `Amazon Glacier, Google and Azure Archive storage classes` 
	- long term storage backup 
	- Used for storing large volumes of data that are rarely accessed.
	- High durability (data rarely lost)
	- Very cheap per GB but you may have to tolerate minutes to upto 48 hours of waiting as high read latency 
- `optical, magnetic, holographic`

### Insights for us application development

- Plan the storage needs based on your app growth
- **Application performance** depends on how data is stored and accessed:
	- Keep frequently used ("hot") data in faster memory
	- Move rarely used ("cold") data to cheaper storage
- Design app based on data access patterns
- Developer must be aware of options and appropriate databases & engines for their application
- Optimize a balance for `latency` read and `throughput` write speed depending on workload
- Prefer $O(1)$ when possible (hashing)
- Use $O(\log N)$ for scalable systems (trees, binary search)
- Avoid $O(N^2)$ and above for large datasets
- Choose data structures based on:
	- Search type (exact vs range)
	- Data size
	- Update frequency
